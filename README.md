## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI** – Data modeling, DAX calculations, dashboard creation  
- **Excel** – Initial data cleaning and transformation  
- **Power Query** – Merging datasets, creating relationships  
- **CSV Files** – Used for raw and cleaned datasets

## 📁 Datasets

The analysis is based on three cleaned datasets:

| File Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `Cleaned_Rating_Dataset.csv` | User ratings of movies with timestamps |
| `movies_cleaned.csv` | Movie details including title, genre, and release year |

All datasets were cleaned to remove duplicates, handle missing values, and standardize formats before loading into Power BI.

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing was completed in **Excel** and **Power BI**, including:
- Cleaning and transforming raw datasets
- Filtering movies released **after 1980**
- Segmenting gender-based preferences for the last **50 years**
